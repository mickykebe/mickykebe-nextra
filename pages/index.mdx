# mickykebe

I'm a software engineer specializing in React with a lot of full-stack experience mainly in node.js.

I'm interested in building large-scale well-architected web apps with great developer experience powering fast product iterations.

These days I mainly work in React, Javascript, Typescript and Node.js. But I've worked with a many other web and mobile app tech in the past.

Besides software I'm interested in issues of economic policy and spend time reading and writing about economic issues with a focus on my home country, Ethiopia.
