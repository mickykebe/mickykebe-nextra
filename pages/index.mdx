# mickykebe

ðŸ‘‹  I'm Michael, a software engineer with over 10 years experience building Full-stack applications.

I'm interested in building large-scale well-architected web apps where great developer experience powers fast product iterations.

These days I mainly work with Javascript, Typescript, React and Node.js.

Besides software I'm interested in issues of economic policy and spend time reading and writing about economic issues with a focus on Ethiopia.
