  description="During my time at levitate I lead the developement of many new app features and revamped many existing features by cleaning up technical debt and rebuilding them on solid foundations. One of my notable accomplishments was building the handwritten card feature set where customers were able to compose and schedule orders of handwritten cards to their clients. This meant building a sytem where - Admins could create and build custom handwritten card templates - Clients could browse the handwritten card available to them - Clients could initiate card order flows where they could customize the card message to the client"

  description="OkCollect is an embeddable address collection library I built that came with some unique challenges. 1. The library needed to be embeddable on any website and on the main native app so it needed to run as vanilla JS. No external dependencies. 2. Part of the address capture flow involved highly interactive maps and forms that had to be launched in a modal that took up larger screen real estate compared to the embedded portion. 3. Short time to market. I built the library as two separate units that worked together as one."
