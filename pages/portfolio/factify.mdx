I was lead engineer building factify which is a data insight dashboard of Ethiopia's social media landscape.

I wore many hats in this project where I worked as:

- Lead engineer building Factify, a full-stack app(React/Node.js) which included features such as
  - Trend/sentiment insights and visualization
  - Sentiment analysis
  - Categorization and labeling tools for the data team
  - Flagging and Debunking tools to counteract false/inciting content
  - Reporting
- Senior engineer building social-media data collection services.
- Lead engineer on infra/hosting wherein several services (ML, data-collection and factify) communicated with each other using tools such as Rabbitmq, Docker, Nginx.
