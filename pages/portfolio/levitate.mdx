During my time at levitate I lead the developement of many new app features and revamped many existing features by cleaning up technical debt and rebuilding them on solid foundations.

One of my notable accomplishments was building the handwritten card feature set where customers were able to compose and schedule orders of handwritten cards to their clients. This meant building a sytem where

- Admins could create and build custom handwritten card templates
- Clients could browse the handwritten card available to them
- Clients could initiate card order flows where they could customize the card message to the client
- Bulk handwritten card flows could be initiated where clients could schedule bulk handwritten card flows to multiple clients(based on filter criterias etc.)
- Orders could be approved/denied based on client balance according to a payment and credit system that was built
- Clients could manage their handwritten card defaults in their settings(signature, address etc.)

Other accomplishments include upgrading email creation flows.

I was also largely responsible for overhauling the app's layout system and dashboard design.

Other major changes I led include

- Migrating the app's server data management approach from a viewmodel system to one based on tanstack-query. Refactored many existing feature sets accordingly, making the codebase more maintainable and amenable to feature upgrades.
- Completed a full overhaul of the build and lint tooling, migrating from tslint to eslint/prettier and placing the project on a gradual path of lint adherence and improved code standards. Improved developer experience. Boosted build perf. by 55%.
