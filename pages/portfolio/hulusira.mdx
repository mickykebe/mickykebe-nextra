Hulusira was a job page app I built for connecting employers and job seekers in Ethiopia.

Some of the stand-out features include

- Social media job tracking. Job posts were automatically shared to hulusira's telegram and facebook pages. When a job is closed on hulusira the respective social media posts were updated accordingly.
- Tight integration with Telegram which is the top social network in Ethiopia. Employers could forgo the web app and manage jobs from hulusira's telegram bot.
- Job post moderation tools where admins can approve genuine jobs and decline spam posts.
- Plus common job board features including searching, filtering, company-specific job pages etc.

Stack: Javascript, Node.js, Typescript, Next.js
